types::c provides type aliases that are compatible with standard C builtin types
and typedefs, as specified ISO/IEC 9899 and POSIX, as well as convenience
functions for working with C types. This module is useful for C interop, for
instance if an external function returns a [[long]] or a [[ssize]], or if you
need to convert between a C string and a Hare string. The types provided here
shouldn't be used for most Hare code.

Some C types aren't provided by this module, since they are provided by the Hare
language itself:

- _Bool, bool  -> bool
- (signed) int -> int
- size_t       -> size
- unsigned int -> uint
- uintptr_t    -> uintptr
- va_list      -> valist

Some C types are mostly compatible with Hare types, with minor differences:

- C's void is an incomplete opaque type, which is also used to indicate the
  absence of a value. Hare provides void as a zero-size type, and opaque as an
  undefined-size opaque type.
- Hare doesn't have builtin imaginary or complex types, though complex types
  with equivalent represention to their C counterparts are declared in
  [[math::complex::]]. Hare doesn't allow casting between real and complex types
  like C does.

Additional low-level or implementation-specific types may be defined in
[[rt::]].
