# cache key is formed by hashing:
# - list of input file hashes
# - config hash
# - dependency abi hashes
#
# A module is up-to-date if:
# - All of its directories have a valid cached mtime, or
# 	- All of its files have a valid cached mtime, or
# 	- All of its files have a valid cached SHA
#   and,
# - Its config hash matches
# - The most up-to-date version of their dependencies have a matching ABI hash
#
# If a module is NOT up-to-date, it is scheduled for rebuild, and its new ABI
# hash is computed so that any dependencies of that module can consult it to
# determine if they also need to be rebuilt.
